1. TensorFlow
What it is: TensorFlow is a powerful open-source library developed by Google for creating machine learning and deep learning models.

Distinct Features:
Flexibility: You can build complex models easily and customize them as needed.
Performance: It can run on multiple CPUs and GPUs, making it fast for large computations.
Deployment: You can easily deploy your model on various platforms (like web, mobile, etc.).
Ecosystem: It has a large community and many tools that work with it, like TensorBoard for visualization.



2. Keras
What it is: Keras is a high-level API (Application Programming Interface) that runs on top of TensorFlow (and can also use other backends like Theano).

Distinct Features:
User-Friendly: Keras is designed to be simple and easy to use, making it great for beginners.
Fast Prototyping: You can quickly build and test models with fewer lines of code.
Modularity: You can easily add layers, optimizers, and metrics to your models.
Integration with TensorFlow: Since Keras is built on TensorFlow, it benefits from TensorFlow's power and flexibility.


3. Theano
What it is: Theano is one of the first deep learning libraries, created at the University of Montreal. While it's less popular now, it helped lay the groundwork for others.

Distinct Features:
Efficiency: Theano can optimize the performance of mathematical operations, making it faster for certain tasks.
Symbolic Computation: You define and optimize expressions symbolically, which can help in reducing computation time.
GPU Support: It can run calculations on GPUs, which speeds up training for deep learning models.
Deprecated: Note that Theano is no longer actively maintained, so it might not be the best choice for new projects.


4. PyTorch
What it is: PyTorch is another open-source library developed by Facebook, known for its dynamic computation graph.

Distinct Features:
Dynamic Graphing: Unlike TensorFlow (until version 2.0), PyTorch allows you to change the architecture of your neural network on the fly, making debugging easier.
Easy to Use: It has a simple and intuitive interface, making it popular among researchers and developers.
Strong Community Support: PyTorch has gained a lot of popularity, especially in academic settings, leading to a wealth of resources and tutorials.
Integration with Python: It feels more like regular Python programming, which makes it easier for Python developers to adopt.



Summary
TensorFlow is powerful and flexible, great for production use.
Keras is easy to use and built on TensorFlow, perfect for quick development.
Theano was groundbreaking but is now outdated and not maintained.
PyTorch is user-friendly with dynamic graphing, making it popular for research.
